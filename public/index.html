        <h2>The week before my Maymester in Copenhagen</h2>
        <p>May 14, 2019</p>
        <p>I am currently sitting in the Heathrow airport in London writing this blog post. 
            These readings have taken a suprisingly long time to complete as 
            I have been working on them throughout my travel journey. Unfortunately between finals 
            and 15 of my friends graduating, I have not had a moment to work on this until now so I'm scrambling a bit.
            I am working as I wait for my connecting flight to Amsterdam with my partner, Thomas. 
            He just graduated from UNC and we are traveling the week before my Maymester to celebrate together 
            before he moves to Boston. Together we are going to Amsterdam, Brussels, Bruges, and Copenhagen. 
            <strong>We plan to celebrate my 21st birthday in Amsterdam and Brussels.</strong>
            We are meeting my best friend, Eva, in Copenhagen. Eva has been studying abroad in Spain all semester
            so I am so excited to reunite and spend some time with her. </p>
        <p>Eva, Thomas and I will be together in Copenhagen for three days before my Maymester program starts.
            Then Eva and Thomas will travel to Budapest together before Eva returns back to NC. After Budapest, 
            Thomas is planning to backpack alone to many other cities starting with Vienna. As of now he is planning to then 
            go to Munich, Florence, Rome, Como, Paris, and London. It will be quite the adventure for him! At the end of my 
            program in Copenhagen, I plan to visit my friend and soon to be roommate, Lizzie, in London for a day before 
            I fly back home to start my summer internship in NC.</p>
        <p> So this is my introductory blog post about my general plans for before and after this Maymester begins. 
            I am beyond excited for everything that this program will entail and will 
            definitely be updating this page with more blogs to include much more detail later. 
            Lastly, here is a list of all the cities I hope to visit in the next month:  </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Amsterdam</li>
            <li>Brussels</li>
            <li>Bruges</li>
            <li>Copenhagen</li>
            <li>Either Stockholm, Gothenburg, or Hamburg</li>
            <li>London</li>
        </ul>

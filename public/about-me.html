        <img src='images/me.jpg' width='500'/>
        <p>I am a rising senior at UNC double majoring in Computer Science and Information Science with a 
            minor in Spanish for Business. I have been a COMP110 TA for 3 semesters now and am heavily involved 
            with the planning of the UNC CS Diversity Panel event at each semester. After my time in Copenhagen, I 
            will be returning to North Carolina to intern at Fidelity Investments in Durham this summer.
